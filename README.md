# dotfiles
Dotfiles are simple text files that, for the purpose of this repo, determine behavior in my linux laptop.
These files are basic, and may be short or hundreds of files of code.
I personalize, edit, and perfect these files to optimize my personal linux use-case.
Additionally, it exists as a backup.
Includeded are things like my standard background wallpaper.
